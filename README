This is a Jenkins plugin that will publish Jenkins Job run events
(start, complete, finish) to a ZMQ PUB socket. By default the PUB
socket is on TCP port 8888 and no Job events will be published.
You can choose to enable event publishing for all jobs in the
Jenkins' global config or enable the plugin on a per job basis.

To build this plugin you will need to have libzmq installed on your
Jenkins server. You will also need to build a local copy of jzmq
for the architecture of your Jenkins server. To get a build of jzmq
that worked I had to tweak jzmq version 2.1.0 slightly. You can
get that version at:

    https://github.com/cboylan/jzmq

First clone the above repository and check out the 2.1.0-build-fix
branch. Then run the following commands to build jzmq:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
    #I had to skip tests as they would not run
    maven clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Now you can build this plugin:

    maven clean package
    # Copy target/zmq-event-publisher.hpi to the Jenkins
    # plugin dir and restart Jenkins.

All of this will be much easier if you use the same OS and CPU
architecture on your build host as on the Jenkins server.

TODO:
Better error handling (eg bind errors due to port conflicts)
Avoid reading in the global config for each event if possible.
Cleanup config.jelly for the non global Job config.

This plugin borrows heavily from the Jenkins Notification Plugin
https://github.com/jenkinsci/notification-plugin. That plugin
does much of the same work and where applicable I have gone the
easy route and copied the work they have done.
